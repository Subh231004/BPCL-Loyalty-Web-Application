Branching and commit guidelines
- Use short, clear branch names: `feature/login-form`, `fix/navbar-responsive`.
- Write clear commit messages: `feat: add dealer registration form` or `fix: responsive header on mobile`.

Code style
- Keep markup semantic.
- Prefer external CSS files (do not inline large styles).
- Keep JS unobtrusive and modular.

File and asset changes
- If you add images, place them in `BPCL/img/`.
- If you propose reorganizing files (moving many files), open an issue first so we can review the plan.

Review process
- PRs should include a short description of the change, screenshots if applicable, and testing instructions.
- One or two approvals required before merge (depending on the size of the change).

Thank you!
